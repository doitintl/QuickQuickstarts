# AWS Lambda 

Prerequisites: An AWS Account and the AWS CLI with credentials configured. 

The script `deploy.sh` is _not_  rerunnable: It will fail on the second run if you don't clean up resources.

A [Getting Started article](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-awscli.html) for Lambda with the CLI is available.

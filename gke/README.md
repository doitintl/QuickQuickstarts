# Google Kubernetes Engine

Prerequisites: An initialized  `gcloud` CLI tool with a default project.

The script `deploy.sh` is _not_  rerunnable: It will not update the service if you change the code. This can easily be achieved by versioing the container; this was omitted for brevity.

A [Quickstart article](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart) for GKE is available.

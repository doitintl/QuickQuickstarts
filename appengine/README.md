# Google AppEngine Standard Environment

Prerequisites: An initialized  `gcloud` CLI tool with a default project.

The script `deploy.sh` is rerunnable to deploy new code. 

Note that it replaces an existing version as the default exposed service, so use this only on a development project over which you have full control.

A [Quickstart article](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/quickstart) for Python3 on App Engine Standard Environment is available.
